## Introduction

Taking inspiration from the incredible Boston Dynamics Spot robot, this project aims to replicate a quadruped robot within a simulated environment using Gazebo. Embrace the world of robotics as we explore the design, modeling, and simulation aspects, all powered by ROS Noetic. Control the virtual quadruped and experience the thrill of robotics in action.
## Dependencies

- OS: Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa
- ROS Version: ROS Noetic
- Python

## System Architecture

**Solidworks Design:** The robot's intricate design was crafted with precision in Solidworks, ensuring functionality and aesthetics go hand in hand.

**URDF Integration:** By converting the Solidworks model to URDF, I harnessed the power of ROS to control and communicate with the robot.

**Inverse Kinematics:** The project delves into the fascinating realm of inverse kinematics, using DH parameters and the Jacobian method to plan and execute leg trajectories.

**Gazebo Simulation:** The robot came to life in the Gazebo simulation environment, providing an immersive and realistic testing ground.

**ROS Communication:** Leveraging the ROS framework, I orchestrated seamless communication between the simulation and the robot, facilitating efficient control.

**Python Control Script:** To interact with the robot, I created a Python script that allows easy control using a keyboard, making the simulation interactive and user-friendly.
